## What is APatch?

::: info
[There](/en/what-is-apatch) is a more complete introduction.
:::

APatch is a root solution similar to Magisk or KernelSU which is one of the best of both. It combines Magisk easy and convenient installation method via `boot.img` with KernelSU powerful kernel patching abilities.

## What is the difference of APatch and Magisk?

Magisk modifies the `init` system with a patch to the `ramdisk` of your boot image. APatch patches the kernel directly.

## What is the difference of APatch and KernelSU?

KernelSU requires your device's kernel source code, which is not always provided by the OEM. APatch only need your stock `boot.img`.

## What is the difference of APatch, Magisk and KernelSU?

APatch allows you to optionally not modify SELinux, this means the app thread can be rooted without `libsu` and `IPC`.

**KPModule** provided.

## What is KPModule?

Some code runs in kernel space, similar to **Loadable Kernel Modules** (LKM).

Additionally, the KPM provides the ability to execute `inline-hook` and `syscall-table-hook` in kernel space.

Please read [How to write KPM](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch/blob/main/doc/zh-CN/module.md) for more information.

## What is the relationship of APatch and KernelPatch?

APatch depends on KernelPatch. It inherits all of its capabilities and has been expanded.

You can install just KernelPatch, but this doesn't allow you to use APM.

To use the SuperUser management, you need install APatch, and uninstall KernelPatch.

[Learn more about KernelPatch](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch).

## What is SuperKeyï¼Ÿ

KernelPatch adds a new system call (syscall) to provide all capabilities to apps and programs in userspace, this syscall is referred to as **SuperCall**. When an app/program tries to invoke **SuperCall**, it needs to provide an access credential, known as the **SuperKey**. **SuperCall** can only be successfully invoked if the **SuperKey** is correct and if it's not the caller will remain unaffected.

## How to process the SELinux?

KernelPatch not modify the SELinux context but bypasses SELinux via hook. This allows you to root an Android thread within the app context without the need to use `libsu` to start a new process and then perform `IPC`.

In addition, APatch uses the `magiskpolicy` to add addition support of SELinux directly. 

## WebUI of APM/KPM

The APatch source code has been derived and modified from KernelSU, so APatch introduced WebUI feature in version [10568](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch/releases/tag/10568) after KernelSU introduced WebUI feature.

APatch WebUI implementation and requirements is completely same as KernelSU, WebUI designed for KernelSU modules can run perfectly in APatch.

If you want to design WebUI for APM or KPM, please refer to the [WebUI introduction](https://kernelsu.org/guide/module-webui.html) of KernelSU for further information.

## Can not install modules (os error 2/5/22)?

Remove the root permission of "shell" application in SuperUser page.

## App granted/lost root permission automatically when rebooting device?

Read [this](https://t.me/APatchChannel/74).

## Can not use Shamiko?

We can not support Shamiko due to its close-source and no updates.
::: info
If you have to use Shamiko, please use version [0.7.4](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases/tag/shamiko-188).
:::

## Zygisk support?

APatch can use the [ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) to add the Zygisk support.

::: warning
Use the official build of ZygiskNext instead of the third-party modified version, unless you can confirm that it is harmless.
Due to some reasons, we recommended to use the version [0.9.1.1](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases/tag/v4-0.9.1.1) of ZygiskNext if no serious issues is appeared and you do not need to use WebUI feature.
:::

APatch also can use the [Zygisk_mod](https://github.com/Admirepowered/Zygisk_mod) to add the Zygisk support.

If you only need to use LSPosed without other Zygisk features, you also can try [Zloader](https://github.com/Mufanc/z-loader) [for LSPosed](https://t.me/mufanc_chan/28) to load LSPosed simply.

::: warning
Zloader is NOT compatible with any Zygisk implementation, for example, ZygiskNext or Zygisk_mod. Please disable or uninstall any Zygisk implementation before using Zloader.
:::

::: info
Zloader is still in early development, welcome to commit Pull requests to Zloader developers or open an issue for any usage issues.

## Can not pass the root-detecting application?

If your software is working properly, don't worry too much about the detection software.
